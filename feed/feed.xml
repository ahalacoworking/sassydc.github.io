				<title>Sass 102</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sure, you fell in love with Sass when you wrote your first variable, saved gobs of time by nesting your selectors, and maybe even wrote a mixin or two. But there&amp;#39;s so much more that Sass can do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we&amp;#39;ll go through what makes Sass more of a real programming language: data types and control structures. We&amp;#39;ll look through lists, looping and even the new Sass &amp;quot;maps&amp;quot; data type in version 3.3, along some real-world examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tracy Rotton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taupecat.com/&quot;&gt;Tracy Rotton&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taupecat&quot;&gt;@taupecat&lt;/a&gt;) is the Lead Web Developer at RP3 Agency specializing in front end, WordPress and responsive development. She has spoken at WordCamps in Baltimore (and soon in Miami and Philadelphia as well), and was a recent guest on the Shop Talk Show podcast. She&amp;#39;s also writing a book on building responsive WordPress themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When not doing web things, you can find Tracy skiing, rooting for her Washington Redskins, or spending time with her two kids.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Say Yes to Yeoman!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeoman is a set of tools and conventions for developing client side web applications. It combines three of the most popular front-end workflow tools: Grunt (for automation), Bower(for package management), and Yo (for scaffolding boilerplate code). We’ll take a high level look at what these tools do and how they can improve your everyday development process — lots of concept, not too much code! We’ll also examine how Yeoman and the projects around it are becoming concentrations of best practices and developer knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Wierzbowski works at Think Through Math, where he specializes in front-end development and build systems. He spends way too much time working on open source.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Managing Responsive Image Display with Sass</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sass can&amp;#39;t help you swap out image sources, but it can be incredibly helpful in managing display variations across different screen sizes. Using real life examples from building the redesign of National Geographic Magazine we&amp;#39;ll work our way from assessing the challenges to how using variables, mixins, and placeholder classes will keep your source code organized, extensible, and—most importantly—manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Perspectives on File Structure</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Organizing a project&amp;#39;s file structure is the first step to maximizing its efficiency while working on it. This is a subject that causes much debate because there isn&amp;#39;t really one solid method that is optimized for every scenario. This presentation explores various file organization approaches based on project depth and team size.&lt;/p&gt;
