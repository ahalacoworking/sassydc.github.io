Yeoman is a set of tools and conventions for developing client side web applications. It combines three of the most popular front-end workflow tools: Grunt (for automation), Bower(for package management), and Yo (for scaffolding boilerplate code). We’ll take a high level look at what these tools do and how they can improve your everyday development process — lots of concept, not too much code! We’ll also examine how Yeoman and the projects around it are becoming concentrations of best practices and developer knowledge.

Robert Wierzbowski works at Think Through Math, where he specializes in front-end development and build systems. He spends way too much time working on open source.
