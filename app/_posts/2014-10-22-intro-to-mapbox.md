Learn how to design a beautiful custom map for your next website or app! We'll walk through the whole process – from data to live map – using [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), a new map design tool. We'll also take a closer look at styling in Mapbox Studio with CartoCSS, a language based on CSS.
