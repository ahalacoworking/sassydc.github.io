Sure, you fell in love with Sass when you wrote your first variable, saved gobs of time by nesting your selectors, and maybe even wrote a mixin or two. But there's so much more that Sass can do!

In this talk, we'll go through what makes Sass more of a real programming language: data types and control structures. We'll look through lists, looping and even the new Sass "maps" data type in version 3.3, along some real-world examples.
