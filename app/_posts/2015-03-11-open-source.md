On August 7th, 2011 I pushed my first commit to my first open source project, Sassy Modular Scale. This project sparked my journey into the budding Sass community and evolved my understanding of software and design as it evolved. On February 16th, 2015 the project came full circle as I helped to re-launch the website that inspired my first few lines of open source code, modularscale.com.

### Scott Kellum

Iâ€™m a designer and front end developer at Vox Media working to make amazing products for our readers and writers. I grew up in the suburbs of DC but moved to NYC for school and never moved back. Had a run as a professional type designer at [Darden Studio](http://dardenstudio.com/) and first made my mark on the web at Treesaver. I enjoy cat gifs, hammocks, and great food.
