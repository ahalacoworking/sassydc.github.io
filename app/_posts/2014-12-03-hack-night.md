Join us for an open hack night! Get guidance while exploring the [Sass language](http://sass-lang.com/) with [Sassmeister](http://sassmeister.com/) or [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), recieve help with getting Sass or [Libsass](http://libsass.com/) compiling on your own computer, or put your head together with others to crack a particularly challenging Sass nut.

Send a note to [@dcsassmeetup](https://twitter.com/dcsassmeetup) or <dcsassmeetup@gmail.com> if you'd like to request specific help in advance or volunteer to be a tutor so we can make sure we have a good match of skill sets.
