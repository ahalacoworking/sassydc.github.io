=================

This [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site was scaffolded using [Generator Jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb) and is deployed using [Grunt Build Control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

To get started run the following commands:

``` bash
$ git clone -b develop git@github.com:sassydc/sassydc.github.io.git
$ cd sassydc.github.io/
$ npm install && bundle install && bower install
```

After that you can run `grunt serve` to develop, `grunt serve:dist` to preview a "dist" build, and `grunt deploy` to deploy.
